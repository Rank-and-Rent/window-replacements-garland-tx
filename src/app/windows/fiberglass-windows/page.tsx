    intro: "Fiberglass solves the two technical failure modes that show up most often on Garland window inspections. The first is hail damage: the spring storm corridor that crosses Hwy 78 and the I-30 Rockwall line drops 1-2 inch hail on Camelot, Naaman Forest, and Eastern Hills with frequency, and pultruded fiberglass frames absorb that impact load without splitting at the welded corners the way vinyl can. The second is the post-Uri freeze cycle—the February 2021 freeze taught Garland homeowners that frame materials with high thermal expansion (vinyl, in particular) shift enough during the deep dip to break sash seals. Fiberglass expands at almost the same rate as the glass it holds, so the seals stay tight through 100-plus-degree summers off the I-635 corridor and sub-20-degree freeze events. Marvin and Andersen pultruded fiberglass is what we install when an owner wants the longest-warranty, lowest-failure-rate frame Garland&apos;s climate will accept.",

        heading: 'Unrivaled Structural Strength for Garland Homes',
        content: "Fiberglass is fundamentally stronger than any other window frame material, making it ideal for Garland\'s occasional severe weather and hail storms. The material\'s tensile strength exceeds steel while maintaining flexibility that prevents cracking during temperature extremes. Unlike vinyl that can become brittle or wood that warps, fiberglass maintains perfect alignment and smooth operation year-round in Garland\'s variable climate.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Superior Thermal Performance Reduces Costs',
        content: "Fiberglass\'s naturally low thermal conductivity creates exceptional insulating properties that significantly reduce energy costs in Garland\'s hot summers. The material conducts heat 500 times slower than aluminum and far better than wood, creating a natural thermal barrier. Garland homeowners typically see 35-45% reductions in heating and cooling costs with fiberglass windows.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Authentic Wood Beauty Without Maintenance',
        content: "Modern fiberglass windows replicate the natural beauty of wood with stunning accuracy, yet require none of the maintenance that authentic wood demands in Garland\'s climate. Advanced manufacturing creates wood-grain textures virtually indistinguishable from real wood, perfect for Garland\'s historic neighborhoods while eliminating annual refinishing requirements.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Moisture Resistance for Texas Climate',
        content: "Fiberglass is inherently moisture-resistant, making it perfect for Garland\'s humid summers and occasional heavy rains. Unlike wood that absorbs moisture and rots, fiberglass remains impervious to water damage. The material never needs sealing or protective treatments, preventing mold and mildew growth that can compromise indoor air quality.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Design Flexibility and Customization',
        content: "Fiberglass\'s workability allows manufacturers to create virtually any window style, size, or configuration. The material accommodates complex curves and irregular shapes that would be difficult with other materials. Available in unlimited color options, fiberglass windows match Garland\'s diverse architectural styles from traditional ranch homes to contemporary designs.",
      },
      {
        heading: 'Environmental and Health Advantages',
        content: "Fiberglass represents a responsible choice for environmentally conscious Garland homeowners. The material is 100% recyclable and requires no toxic preservatives. Long service life means fewer replacements over time, reducing manufacturing impacts. For families concerned about health and environmental impact, fiberglass windows provide premium performance with lower ecological footprint.",
